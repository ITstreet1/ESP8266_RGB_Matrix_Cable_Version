# ESP8266_RGB_Matrix_Cable_Version
This version of the ESP8266 RGB Matrix that consists of two boards joined together with a cable. My first version used a NodeMCU along with way too many jumper wires. This version uses one five pin cable and a larger pair to power the matrix.

Check out http://www.instructables.com/id/RGB-LED-Matrix-With-an-ESP8266/ for all the details like wire diagram and Arduino library.

Check out the Files under the PCB directory for a parts list, schematic and gerber files to make your own.
